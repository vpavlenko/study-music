- [HookTheory](https://hooktheory.com/affiliate/275-0-3-2.html) - A database of many rock songs and some jazz songs and game tunes focused at harmonic analysis. Comes with a melody-harmony online editor [HookPad](https://hooktheory.com/affiliate/275-3-3-3.html) and [two must-read online books](https://hooktheory.com/affiliate/275-2-3-1.html) on pop/rock harmony which explain Roman numeral analysis, secondary chords and modes. **You should probably start with those books** unless you already have a college degree in music. You can read them in two weeks if you focus enough.
